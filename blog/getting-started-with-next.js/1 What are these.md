summary: 'Next.js is based on React and provides an easy way of building web applications. Interestingly, it can generate SSG and SSR. SSG (Static Site Generation) generates HTML pages at build time, resulting in faster performance and lower server load for static content by serving pre-built files. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) generates dynamic HTML on the server for each request, offering real-time, personalized content but requiring more server resources and potentially slowing initial page loads'

# Imperative vs. declarative programming

To create a Pizza
 - imperative programming - giving steps by step to chef is 
 - declarative programming - ordering a pizza and chef making it is
 
 So, 
 1. Writing JavaScript manipulations like CreateElement, element.AppendElement etc. is imperative programming.
 2. React is A declarative UI library: instead of writing everything, we can ask React to create an H1 with a text.
    - ```<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>```
    - ```<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>```
    
## React vs Normal JavaScript based

Doing the same thing with both technologies - adding a header to doc.

### React with JSX (JS extension)

```js
<script type="text/jsx">
  const domNode = document.getElementById('app');
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domNode);
  root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
</script>
```

### Normal JavaScript

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  const header = document.createElement('h1');
  const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
  const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
  header.appendChild(headerContent);
  app.appendChild(header);
</script>
```

## React has 3 concepts
1. Components
2. Props
3. State

## 1. React Components

React Component is a JavaScript function that returns a UI element in the return statement (with JSX). Then you can use that UI element as a HTML tag inside HTML.

```js
<script type="text/jsx">
    function Header() { // must be capital
      return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
    }
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
    // Capitalize the React Component
    root.render(<Header />);
</script>
```

You can use this approach to create a model for your website.

e.g.: Following is an example how components can be created & organized
![top-level HomePage component](learn-component-tree.png "top-level HomePage component")

Above HomePage component has 3 child elements, Header, Articles and Footer.  Header has Logo, Title and Nav etc. 

## 2. React Props

You can pass pieces of information as properties to React components. These are called props. Similar to a JavaScript function, you can design components that accept custom arguments (or props) that change the component.

*Note:* In React, data flows down the component tree. This is referred to as one-way data flow.

## 2. React State

TODO

# Next.js - How to

1. For Next.js, the main file is app/page.js
Create it.

```jsx
function Header({ title }) { // caps
  return <h1>{title ? title : "Default title"}</h1>
}

export default function HomePage() {

  const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Margaret Hamilton"]

  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li key={name}>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

2. Install required dependencies

```
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
```

This generates following files/directories.

- node_modules
    - this has all the dependency libraries
- package.json 
    - file has all the dependencies.
- package-lock.json file 
    - that contains detailed information about the exact versions of each package.


With the above `npm install`, package.json gets followings.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.5.4",
    "react": "^19.1.1",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.1"
  }
}
```

3. Live changes - Running it as a development server

Add scripts to package.json manually

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.0.3",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }
}
```

Now, run this in `dev` mode. 

`npm run dev`
OR
`yarn run dev`

__Note__: No any difference in npm or yarn, it is (yarn) only a faster tool.

A .next directory is created 
A new file called /app/layout.js is auto generated with below content, this is the main layout of an app.

```js
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js',
  description: 'Generated by Next.js',
};
 
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Application is running in http://localhost:3000

4. Generate Static Site & View

For that, first generated the static site by adding a script to build the site into package.json.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build" # next build is the command
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.5.4",
    "react": "^19.1.1",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.1"
  }
}
```
Now, generate it.

`yarn build` or `npm build`

This generates a `./out` directory with static site.

You can copy this to S3 or any other location.

To check locally, start a http-server and see.

`npx http-server ./out`

This will start a server at 8080 port.
